# Astropy

In this final chapter we introduce the Astropy package. In this module we only provide a bried introduction, but you will be making more use of the package later in the AST4007W course.

Astropy is an open-source and community-developed Python package. It contains core astronomy-related functionality. It was started in 2011 to bring together developers across the field of astronomy in order to coordinate the development of a common set of Python tools for astronomers.

The website can be found at <https://www.astropy.org/>, which also contains links to examples, tutorials and the documentation.

## Supported File Formats

Astropy provides support for domain-specific file formats such as:

- Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files
- Virtual Observatory (VO) tables
- common ASCII table formats,
- unit and physical quantity conversions
- physical constants specific to astronomy
- celestial coordinate and time transformations,
- world coordinate system (WCS) support
- e.t.c

We cover working with the FITS files in the final tutorial.
