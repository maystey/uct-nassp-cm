# # Numerical Root Finding

# A common problem we have to solve is finding the solution of equations of the form:
# 
# $$
# f(x) = 0
# $$
# 
# In the case where a simple analytic solution does not exist, numerical solutions can be employed. We shall take a look at three of these techniques: the bisection method, the secant method and the Newton Raphson method.
# 
# All of these methods require that the function $f$ is continuous around the root.
