# Linear Regression Algorithms

Regression is used to fit models to data, finding the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression is also used in machine learning, although this is well beyond the scope of this course.

In this chapter we cover how to implement two linear regression algorithms. We then use SciPy to perform the similar algorithms, but for non-linear cases as well.
